# Original Email Body in Auto-Replies

## Overview

This feature includes the full original email content in auto-reply messages for human reviewers during the initial prototype phase. This allows the client's HR team to see the complete enquiry when following up with senders.

## Current Status

**CURRENTLY DISABLED FOR TESTING** - The feature is commented out to avoid long emails during development.

## How to Enable for Production

1. Open `backend/email_functions/auto_reply.py`
2. Find the comment `# ENABLE FOR PRODUCTION:` (around line 130)
3. Uncomment the block below it:

```python
# Change this:
# if original_email_body and original_email_body.strip():
#     # Format original email for text version
#     original_content_section_text = f"""
# 
# ------- ORIGINAL ENQUIRY -------
# {original_email_body}
# ------- END ORIGINAL ENQUIRY -------
# 
# """

# To this:
if original_email_body and original_email_body.strip():
    # Format original email for text version
    original_content_section_text = f"""

------- ORIGINAL ENQUIRY -------
{original_email_body}
------- END ORIGINAL ENQUIRY -------

"""
```

## Auto-Reply Format with Original Email

When enabled, auto-replies will include:

3. **Professional Response**: Can craft informed replies based on complete information
4. **Audit Trail**: Full conversation context is preserved in the auto-reply

## Testing

Run the test script to see how it works:

```bash
python test_original_email_body.py
```

This will show:
- How the feature integrates with the auto-reply system
- Instructions for enabling/disabling
- Sample output format

## Configuration

The feature is controlled by the `original_email_body` parameter in the `send_auto_reply()` function:

```python
await send_auto_reply(
    recipient="user@example.com",
    ticket_number="ARG-20240601-0123",
    original_subject="Leave Request",
    sender_name="John Doe",
    priority="Normal",
    ai_summary="Request for annual leave...",
    original_email_body="Dear HR Team, I would like to..."  # This enables the feature
)
```

## Security Considerations

- Original email content is included as-is, so ensure no sensitive data exposure
- HTML content is properly escaped to prevent injection attacks
- The feature should only be used with trusted internal email systems

## Future Enhancements

- Option to truncate very long emails
- Configurable formatting templates
- Admin setting to globally enable/disable
- Integration with email threading for multi-message conversations
