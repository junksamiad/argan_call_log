I hope you are well. I am writing to seek your advice on an ongoing issue with one of our care assistants, Ms Jane Smith, who has recently shown a pattern of late arrivals and noticeable decline in work performance. This has become a concern for both resident care and team morale.

Over the past three weeks, Ms Smith has arrived late to her shifts on five occasions, ranging from 15 to 45 minutes late. Additionally, I have received feedback from other staff members that she appears disengaged during shifts and has missed some important care tasks that were documented in resident care plans.

I have spoken with Ms Smith informally about these issues, and while she acknowledged the concerns, there has been no improvement. I believe we now need to escalate this matter through proper HR procedures.

Could you please advise on the appropriate next steps? Should we initiate a formal disciplinary process, and if so, what documentation do I need to prepare? I want to ensure we handle this sensitively but also maintain our high standards of care.

I would appreciate your guidance on this matter at your earliest convenience, as it is affecting the quality of care we provide to our residents.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Sarah Williams
