# AI Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the email processing system from regex-based routing to AI-powered classification, extraction, and conversation threading.

## Implementation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: AI Ticket Classification - COMPLETED
- [x] Create `email_functions/classification/` directory
- [x] Implement `email_classifier_agent.py` 
  - AI-powered ticket detection in subject line AND email body
  - Handles variations: "ARG-20250531-0003", "ticket ARG20250531-0003", etc.
  - Context-aware detection (real replies vs coincidental matches)
  - Structured output with Pydantic schemas
- [x] Integrate with `email_router.py` to use AI classification
- [x] Test with various email formats and edge cases
- [x] Add graceful fallback to regex routing if AI fails
- [x] Complete logging with emoji categorization
- [x] Created comprehensive test scripts and documentation

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: AI-Enhanced Email Processing - COMPLETED
- [x] Implement AI metadata extraction in `email_classifier_agent.py`
  - Extract structured metadata: sender details, urgency keywords, sentiment
  - Parse email content for HR-specific insights
  - Identify deadline mentions and policy references
  - Output structured JSON for Airtable storage
- [x] Enhanced `initial_email/initial_email.py` with AI extraction
  - Full integration with AI classification results
  - Stores extracted structured data in Airtable (43 fields)
  - Generates intelligent auto-replies based on AI analysis
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Gmail delivery issue resolved
  - Fixed malformed email address parsing in webhook handler
  - Properly extracts clean email addresses from "Name <email@domain.com>" format
  - Gmail now accepts emails without "555 5.5.2 Syntax error"
- [x] Complete Airtable integration with AI metadata
  - All 43 fields properly configured and working
  - AI confidence scores, sentiment analysis, urgency tracking
  - Conversation threading and ticket management
- [x] Comprehensive testing and validation
  - AI classification: 98-99% confidence scores
  - Email delivery: SendGrid 202 Accepted, Gmail delivery working
  - End-to-end flow: Webhook ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Airtable ‚Üí Auto-reply ‚úÖ

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: AI Summarization & Categorization  
- [ ] Implement `summarizer.py` (reusable component)
  - Domain-specific HR query categorization (leave, policy, complaint, etc.)
  - Automatic priority/urgency assessment
  - Generate executive summaries
  - Sentiment analysis for handling approach
- [ ] Integrate with initial email processing
- [ ] Update database schema to store AI-generated insights
- [ ] Test categorization accuracy across HR domains

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Existing Email Conversation Threading
- [ ] Enhance `email_extractor.py` for conversation parsing
  - Strip quoted text from new content
  - Identify multiple conversation blobs in single email
  - Extract reply-specific metadata (timestamps, senders)
- [ ] Implement conversation threading in `existing_email/existing_email.py`
  - Find existing ticket in database
  - Parse and structure reply content
  - Append to `conversation_content` field as structured array
  - Maintain chronological order and sender tracking
- [ ] Update database schema for conversation history storage
- [ ] Test with complex email threads and multiple participants

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working Now (Phase 1 & 2 Complete)
- **AI Classification**: GPT-4.1 accurately classifies emails as NEW_EMAIL or EXISTING_EMAIL (98-99% confidence)
- **Smart Ticket Detection**: Finds ticket numbers in subject AND body with context awareness
- **AI Metadata Extraction**: Extracts urgency keywords, sentiment, contact details, deadlines
- **Structured Data Storage**: AI extracts and stores 43 fields of structured data in Airtable
- **Gmail Delivery Fix**: Properly handles malformed email addresses from webhooks
- **Complete Email Flow**: Webhook ‚Üí AI Classification ‚Üí Ticket Generation ‚Üí Airtable ‚Üí Auto-reply
- **Robust Routing**: Falls back to regex if AI fails, with comprehensive error handling
- **Enhanced Logging**: Color-coded emoji logging for easy monitoring
- **Production Ready**: Handling real HR inquiries with full automation

### üîß Technical Implementation Details
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 via Responses API with structured outputs
- **Schema**: Pydantic models ensure type safety and validation
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to original regex-based routing
- **Storage**: Complete Airtable integration with 43-field schema
- **Cost**: ~$0.04 per email (~$40/month for 1000 emails)

## Database Schema Updates (Future)
```json
{
  "extracted_data": {
    "contact_info": {...},
    "urgency_indicators": [...],
    "mentioned_dates": [...],
    "policy_references": [...]
  },
  "ai_summary": {
    "category": "leave_request",
    "priority": "normal", 
    "executive_summary": "...",
    "sentiment": "neutral"
  },
  "conversation_content": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-05-31T16:06:55Z",
      "sender": "staff@company.com",
      "type": "initial_query",
      "content": "...",
      "metadata": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Ready to Test

### Basic AI Classification Test
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key first
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

python test_ai_classifier.py
```
